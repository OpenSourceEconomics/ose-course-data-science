Problem sets
############

We provide a set of problem sets to revisit selected issues we discussed during class.

=======================
Potential outcome model
=======================

We explore the potential outcome model using observed and simulated data inspired by the `National Health Interview Survey <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm>`_. The accompanying data sets are available `here <https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/ose-data-science/tree/master/problem-sets/potential-outcome-model/data>`__.

===================
Matching estimators
===================

We compare the consistency of regression and matching estimators using `LaLonde (1986) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1806062>`_ framework and `the Current Population Survey <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html>`_ data. The accompanying data sets are available `here <https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/ose-data-science/tree/master/problem-sets/matching-estimators/data>`__.

===============================
Regression discontinuity design
===============================

We practice RDD with `Lee (2008) <https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0304407607001121?token=B2B8292E08E07683C3CAFB853380CD4C1E5D1FD17982228079F6EE672298456ED7D6692F0598AA50D54463AC0A849065>`_ framework. In particular, we illustrate a discontinuity at the cutoff point with local averages graph, estimate treatment effect by local linear regression and choose an optimal bandwidth by cross-validation procedure. The accompanying data sets are available `here <https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/ose-data-science/tree/master/problem-sets/regression-discontinuity-design/data>`_.
