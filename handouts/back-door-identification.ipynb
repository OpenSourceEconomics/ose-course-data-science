    "This notebook reporduces the presentation from our textbook. A conditioning strategy that utilizes the back-door criterion is implemented in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 1** Write down the back-door paths from the causal variable to the outcome variable, determine which ones are unblocked, and then search for a candidate conditioning set of observed variables that will block all unblocked back-door paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 2** If a candidate conditioning set is found that blocks all back-door paths, inspect the patterns of decent in the graph in order to verify that the variables in the candidate conditioning set do not block or otherwise adjust away any portion of the causal effect of interest.\n",

    "This two step procedure is justified by the following reasoning which constitutes Pearl's back-door criterion."
