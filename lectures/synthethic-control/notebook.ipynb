    "> The model extends the traditional linear panel data (difference-in-differences) framework, allowing that **the effects of unobserved variables on the outcome vary with time**. (Abadie & Diamond & Hainmueller (2010))\n",

    "-> This is the key differnce to the difference-in-difference design. However, it is important to clarify that this statement refers to **!time-constant!** unobserved confounders. Now, the intuition that reproducing well a long time-series of pre-treatment outcomes of the eventually treated unit with a weighted average of the donor pool also picks up the effect of **unobserved confounders**. Then, because these are time-constant, their time-varying effect after treatment is also incporporated.\n",
