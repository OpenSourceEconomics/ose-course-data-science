Our course equips students with the required skills in statistics, technology, and communication to use data for decision-making. Our partnerships with the private and public sector connect students directly with employment opportunities that match their interests and skill set. All information regarding your partners is collected in the `OSE course projects documentation <https://ose-course-projects.readthedocs.io/en/latest/partners/index.html>`__.
